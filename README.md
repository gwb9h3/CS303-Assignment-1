# CS303-Assignment-1
The first assignment for CS303 

To use the function, you must ensure that a Txt file with an integer on each line is in the same folder as the program.
The first prompt that the program asks is to give the name of the file you would like to input into an array.
After this, it will prompt the user to choose five different available functions. 
These functions are the ones outlined in the assignment sheet.
Before the functions are called the program will prompt the user for inputs that will be needed like numbers to be replaced or positions to adjust, If these 
are input incorrectly it will go back to prompt the user which functions they would like to choose. 
Screenshot examples of each function will be put inside a folder named screenshots.
